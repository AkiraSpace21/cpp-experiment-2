## ðŸ“˜ Algorithm Explanation

### âž¤ Bitwise Operation Program

1. Start the program  
2. Initialize two integers `a = 8` and `b = 3`  
3. Perform and display the result of:
   - **Bitwise AND** â†’ `a & b`  
   - **Bitwise OR** â†’ `a | b`  
   - **Bitwise XOR** â†’ `a ^ b`  
   - **Bitwise NOT** of `a` â†’ `~a`  
   - **Left Shift** `a` by 2 â†’ `a << 2`  
   - **Right Shift** `a` by 1 â†’ `a >> 1`  
4. End the program

### âž¤ Bit Manipulation (Set & Clear Bit)

1. Start the program  
2. Initialize a base value `value = 80`  
3. Prompt the user to enter:
   - A bit position to **set**  
   - A bit position to **clear**  
4. Read the bit positions `setPos` and `clearPos` using `cin`  
5. Perform bit manipulation:
   - Set the bit at position 3 using `value | (1 << 3)`  
   - Clear the bit at position 4 using `value & ~(1 << 4)`  
6. Display the results after setting and clearing bits  
7. End the program

## âœ… Conclusion

This experiment introduced the use of **bitwise operators** in C++, which are essential for low-level programming, embedded systems, and optimization tasks.  
I learned how to apply bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shift operations on integers.  
Additionally, I explored how to **set** and **clear** individual bits using masking and shifting techniques.  
These operations are highly efficient and critical for direct memory access, hardware control, and bit-level data processing.
